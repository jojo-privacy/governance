# Jojo Privacy – Governance

This repository defines the governance, decision-making processes, and maintainer responsibilities for the **Jojo Privacy** organization.

Jojo Privacy develops privacy-sensitive and security-critical open-source software.  
As such, clear governance and strict decision processes are required to protect users, contributors, and the long-term integrity of the project.

This repository contains **no product code**.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document:

- How technical and non-technical decisions are made
- Who has authority to review and merge changes

Jojo Privacy operates under the following principles:

- **Security over features**
